# Stack Visualizer

Stack Visualizer is a simple React application that visually demonstrates stack operations such as **push** and **pop**. This project is a great way to understand how a stack works and to see the Last In, First Out (LIFO) principle in action. The application allows users to add values to a stack, view them as they are added, and remove them from the stack.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed on your machine
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/) for version control (optional)

## Usage
1. **Enter a Value**: Type a value into the input field provided at the top of the application.
2. **Push**: Click the "Push" button to add the value to the top of the stack. The stack follows the Last In, First Out (LIFO) principle, so the most recently pushed item is displayed at the top.
3. **Pop**: Click the "Pop" button to remove the top item from the stack. If the stack is empty, a message will display indicating that the stack is empty.
4. **Keyboard Shortcut**: You can press the **Enter** key to quickly push the value entered in the input field onto the stack.

Each item in the stack is color-coded to differentiate between them, and a message is displayed below the buttons to confirm each action.
